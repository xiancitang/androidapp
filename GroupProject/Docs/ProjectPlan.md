**Author**: \<Boqian Wan\>

## 1 Introduction

*This product software, "OfferComparator", allows users to input and save multiple job options on their hands, by freely setting a series of parameters as users' preference, with intuitive scores given to compare.*

## 2 Process Description

*Project development process description as a set of activities; for each development process activity, provide the following:*


**Activity 1**

**Activity name**
*Information Gathering and Initialization*

**Activity description**
- *Communicating with customer, having a comprehensive conversation, getting the idea from customer about the requirements, leading customer with informative questions to make the vision clear, aiming to roughly  know customer's expectation of the software on both function-wise and UI-wise at the end.*

**Entrance criteria**
*Customer's description/idea*


**Exit criteria**
- *Document of listed requirement and goal summarized from customer's input, by developing language*
- *Initial project plan that describes the project development process*

**Activity 2**

**Activity name**
*Inception and Elaboration*

**Activity description**
- *Developers and project managers sitting together brainstorming and discussing about the document and plan, on all the aspects that could be thought of, like development environment, requirements' achievability, etc.*
- *Arrange and discuss on selected and agreed idea/ideas, analyze both requirements acquired from customer and resources owned, then make the decision on direction of the overall design.*
- *Start to build the core architecture, interpret the requirement document deeper into development language, like classes, attributes and methods. Predict and mock possible user move or interaction on the app/software. Consider edge cases and plan of testing.*

**Entrance criteria**
- *Documentation of listed requirement and goal*
- *Brainstorm and discussion outcome on overall design*

**Exit criteria**
- *Complement Project Document, with more specified sections, including well-planned overall time frame and deliverables*
- *UML models- Class Diagram, Use-case Diagram, etc., and corresponding descriptions*
- *Initial Test plan*

**Activity 3**

**Activity name**
*Software Construction*

**Activity description**
- *Start on software construction by building up the app. Arrange the workload and assign to developers.*
- *Developers start and keep on coding, depending on the design models and project documents. Identify the conditions, implement the use cases based on the model diagram, and perform the tests according to the plan. Possibly revise the architecture, add more use cases and update the model now and then- this would be an iteration process.*
- *After possibly multiple iteration and at end of this activity, a prototype of software should be built up, and updated test plan with initial results. An early version is able to be released functionally.*
- *Project Document would also be updated and keep well-arranged, the design and all information should be clear, succinct, and precise.*

**Entrance criteria**
- *Project Document with specified sections and plan*
- *UML and other design models*
- *Initial Test plan*

**Exit criteria**
- *Prototype of application(alpha/beta version)*
- *Test plan with initial results*
- *Updated Project Document*

**Activity 4**

**Activity name**
*Software Transition*

**Activity description**
- *After necessary testing and iterations, the application should be at high completion and final version would be ready to be released to customer, within the planned time frame.*
- *Test plan should be fulfilled with final results; the app should pass all the tests before release. Double check and compare to customer's requirements and expectations from activity 1, make sure they are all met.*
- *Instruction of the app to be provided in case the app itself is not very self-explanatory.*
- *Finalize the Project Document.*

**Entrance criteria**
- *Project Document in development*
- *Prototype of application*
- *Test plan with initial results*

**Exit criteria**
- *Official version of application*
- *Test plan with final results*
- *Finalized Project Document*


## 3 Team
**Project Manager**
- *Plan and schedule the development process*
- *Supervise whole development and assist if needed*

**Software Architect**
- *Define technical and functional architecture of the application*
- *Develop the key components of the application*
- *Build up the frame of application*

**Software Developer**
- *Code and developing the features required*
- *Update the project status to Project Manager*

**Tester**
- *Acknowledge of the requirements and features*
- *Create test cases and execute to detect bugs or defects*
