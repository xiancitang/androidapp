## 2 Use Case Descriptions
## 1 Menu

- *Pre-conditions: No pre-condition is required*
- *Post-conditions: No post-condition is required*
## 2 Enter current Job
- *Requirements: when choosing enter current job the user enter job detail if itâ€™s first time otherwise the system display all the current job information so that the user can edit the information*

- *Pre-conditions: the user should provide these job details i. Title ii. Company iii. Location (entered as city and state) iv. Yearly salary adjusted for cost-of-living v. Yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living vi. Leave time (in days) vii. Number of stock option shares offered viii. Home Buying Program fund (one-time dollar amount up to 15% of Yearly Salary) ix. Wellness Fund ($0 to $5,000 inclusive annually.*

If the user save the current job "JobScore" attribute will be set to 0 as default. Meanwhile,"CurrentJob" is set to be true. Then, the displayed interface will be set to main menu. If "exit without saving" is clicked, simply set the displayed interface to main menu. *

- *Scenarios: enter current job interface or edit current job interface, is handled by "Enter/Edit current Job" button from "fragment_first.xml" interface and "FirstFragment" class has implemented to do the backend logic. these two interfaces should be the same in format. The only difference would be if the current job information is displayed or not. For enter job interface, the current job details are empty as no current job entered. Text fields corresponding to job details are (assigned) empty. For edit current job interface, the current job information are displayed by assigning values to text fields from existing current job instance.*

## 3 Enter Job Offer

Wellness Fund ($0 to $5,000 inclusive annually.*

- *Post-conditions: the user be able to either save the job offer details, add another job offer or cancel and exit without saving, returning in to the main menu.

Meanwhile,1) "NoOfJobOffers" is increased by 1 and 2)"compare offer with current job" button will be enabled. If "cancel" is chosen, the system will display the main menu without saving the entered job offer. To enter another offer, system simply set text fields of "enter job offer" interface to empty. *

- *Scenarios: Once clicked "enter job offers" from "fragment_first.xml" interface, the displayed interface will first set to the interface for "enter job offers". This interface will be similar to "enter current job" interface (same fields would be listed to user to fill) with different operation options (or buttons).*
